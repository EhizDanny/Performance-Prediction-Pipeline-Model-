Often times, parent and teachers are not able to track the performance of their pupils due to differing performance measures.
This project thus creates a model that covers key area of student's academic background that are consequential to performance using
key inputs such as previous grades, continous assesment grades, gender, academic qualification of the parent, distance to school, and other variables that contributes to students' performance were used to create a model. This model evaluates performance and makes prediction based on flows and patterns understood by the system.

Academic Performance prediction using sklearn pipeline model and the deployment on flask and heroku.
