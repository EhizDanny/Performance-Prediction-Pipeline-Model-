Often times, parent and teachers are not able to track the performance of their pupils due to differing performance measures
This project creates a model that covers key area of a student academic information that are consequential to performance, using
key inputs such as previous grades, Continous assesment grades, gender, academic qualification of the parent, distance to school
and other variables that contributes to student performance where used to create a model that evaluates performance and makes prediction based on flows and patterns understood by the system.
Academic Performance prediction using sklearn pipeline model and the deployment on flask and heroku.
